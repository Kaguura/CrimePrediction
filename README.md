# CrimePrediction

Crime rate in San Francisco is one of the highest in the nation according to Neighborhood Scout.
 The aim of this project is to have a better overview as well as prediction what type of crime would occur at a given time and place so that our police force has a better chance of preventing said crimes by knowing what type to spread the man power accordingly. 
For our classification problem, we used various methods such that: Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and Neural Network. Our result spreads across 39 crime categories with a maximum accuracy of 29%. 
This proven to be a hard classification task but we believe with more data in the upcoming years, the result can be improved more.
